Kevin O’Leary, AKA Mr. Wonderful, is well known for his audacious role on Shark Tank, however his history within the business sector has earned him the right to have such a brazen voice in the show. Let’s take a closer look at the man behind the legend and how he came to be the success he is today.</p>
<p>Kevin O’Leary was born in Montreal, Quebec Canada. Learning much from his mother, Kevin began investing his money in high school and took an active interest in how to manage funds properly. His mother taught him to only spend the dividends of his investment and never the principal. That was a lesson that stuck with him for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>O’Leary’s life was forever changed by his very first job at an Ice Cream Parlor when his boss demanded that he scrape gum off the floor. His response was simply, “No” and so he was fired. He vowed then and there to be self-employed for the rest of his life. That moment moved him to attend university despite wanting to be a photographer, and he eventually went on to earn an MBA in entrepreneurship from the Ivey Business School at The University of Western Ontario.</p>
<p>During his time at University, O’Leary took a summer placement job with Nabisco in downtown Toronto. He worked with the company as an assistant brand manager, marketing their cat food after his internship, and was in charge of increasing the brand’s market share.</p>
<p>After his time with Nabisco, he went on to work as a television producer. Shortly thereafter, he founded Special Event Television (SET) and enjoyed moderate success with this venture. One of his partners later bought out his stake in the company for $25,000.</p>
<p>Next O’Leary decided to launch another successful venture, Softkey, a repackager of high-end business software for the consumer market. He secured an investor for $250,000, who later backed out before signing paperwork, and he was ultimately left to find funding elsewhere. Taking the $25,000 he had earned from his sale of SET, O’Leary was able to secure an additional $10,000 from his mother. To get distribution for the software, O’Leary approached printer manufacturers pitching a bundle with their software. It worked. By 1994, Softkey was a billion dollar consolidator in the educational software market, and acquired more than 60 rival companies. Softkey had wiped out the competition thanks to O’Leary’s often unpleasant and fanatical approach to business. Two years later in 1996 Softkey acquired The Learning Company (TLC) for $606 million and took its name. The company was eventually sold by O’Leary for a whopping $4.2 billion to Mattel in 1999. In 2008 he co-founded O’Leary Funds Inc. (a mutual and investment fund management firm that handles over $1.5 billion) with his brother and company director Shane O’Leary. He has built companies bearing his name in a number of other industries including O’Leary Ventures, O’Leary Mortgages, O’Leary books, and O’Leary Fine Wines.</p>
<p>O’Leary has also dabbled in writing and journalism, and released his first book in 2011 entitled Cold Hard Truth: On Business, Money &amp; Life. He followed up that book with Cold Hard Truth On Men, Women, and Money: 50 Common Money Mistakes and How to Fix Them, and Cold Hard Truth on Family, Kids and Money.</p>
<p>O’Leary has appeared on numerous television shows both on and off camera. His resume includes SqueezePlay on the Business News Network, Discovery Project Earth, Dragon’s Den, and of course Shark Tank.</p>
<p>Tenacious, determined, and highly skilled in business, O’Leary will undoubtedly go down as one of the savviest business entrepreneurs of the 21st century.<br />

A resourceful entrepreneur, Daymond John’s evolution from waiting tables at Red Lobster to carving a career with unparalleled success in fashion and branding is quite a story. He credits his success to his love of learning. A true opportunist, Daymond always found a way to up his game and acquire the skills he needed to take his business to the next level. ‘The only thing more expensive than education is ignorance,’ he says, putting his money where his mouth is. Daymond has become a thought leader who regularly shares his wisdom as a sought after branding and business expert and motivational speaker.</p>
<p>Daymond’s creative vision, commitment and sewing skills got the most iconic fashion brand in recent years off the ground from his mother’s remortgaged house in Hollis, Queens. FUBU, standing for “For Us By Us,” tapped into a market that had previously been neglected and paved the way for Daymond’s total innovation of branding strategy. Sharing his neighborhood with Hip Hop artists like RUN DMC and Salt-N-Peppa, FUBU became a synonymous with the emerging music culture that had a dedicated and growing community. When Daymond succeeded in getting various rappers, including superstar LL Cool J, to wear his T-Shirts on their music videos, popularity for his brand soared. He was still waiting tables while building the company for several years, sewing much of the merchandise himself. He recruited a couple of friends and then eventually some seamstresses, who came to work in his mother’s house as sales started to climb.</p>
<p>Drive and improvisation have gotten Daymond through one learning curve after another. The journey from sewing hats in his kitchen to being listed #15 on Details magazine’s list of “50 Most Influential Men” has earned him some valuable lessons. From mastering manufacturing to developing the perfect partnerships, to building and maintaining brand legitimacy, Daymond has become a master strategist. He soon recognized that the only way to fill the gaps in his knowledge was to partner with someone who already knew what he needed to know. When he signed a deal with Samsung America for global distribution, FUBU reached annual sales of $350 million, on a par with Donna Karan New York and Tommy Hilfiger.</p>
<p>Daymond now uses his branding expertise to build new companies through strategic relationships with icons in pop culture. As author of Display of Power: How FUBU Changed A World Of Fashion, The Power of Broke: How Empty Pockets, a Tight Budget, and a Hunger for Success Can Become Your Greatest Competitive Advantage, and The Brand Within: How We Brand Ourselves, From Birth To The Boardroom, Daymond continues to share his wisdom on the power of relationships in building brand success.<br />

<p>As far back as elementary school, Mark Cuban has been a tenacious entrepreneur. Growing up in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, he was the son of a middle class family and watched his father spend the better part of his life working as an auto upholstery professional. His drive to accomplish more and to pave a better life for himself inspired him to make the most of what he was given, and today he is one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the business world.</p>
<p>Cuban’s entrepreneurial spirit was cultivated in middle school and high school when he sold sets of trash bags to fellow students to make money to buy a pair of shoes he desperately wanted. He also sold coins and stamps throughout school and made a name for himself as salesmen before he ever graduated from high school.</p>
<p>After high school, he went on to enroll at Indiana University. During his college years, he purchased and managed the most popular bar in the city. However, after the bar was shut down he moved to Dallas to pursue bigger and better things. Although he initially took a spot as a bartender, he later launched a company called MicroSolutions and sold it in 1990 for $6 million. He cleared roughly $2 million after taxes, but saved another $1 million to pursue additional interests down the line.</p>
<p>At the ripe age of 30, Cuban took the $3 million in his bank account and purchased a $125,000 lifetime pass on American Airlines, and was flying first class anywhere he wanted to. Despite his near ‘’rock star” status, Cuban was still making moves for his future. He started working for a hedge fund and ended up selling it with a partner for $20 million.</p>
<p>In 1995, Cuban and longtime friend Todd Wagner developed a powerful business idea to stream audio over the internet. At the time, it was known as <span class="nolinks">Broadcast.com</span>. Over the next four years, they developed the company and created a significant audience for their services. They eventually sold the company to Yahoo for a record $5.6 billion dollars. Cuban had become a billionaire by the age of 37.</p>
<p>Five years after reaching billionaire status, Cuban took a dramatic turn in his investment portfolio. In 2000, he purchased a majority stake in the Dallas Mavericks. The purchase set him back $285 million, but it might have been his biggest and best investment ever. Forbes reports that the Dallas Mavericks are the fifth most valuable sports franchise in the NBA, worth over $685 million.</p>
<p>Today, Mark Cuban is married with three children and continues to make major strides within the business and entertainment world. His appearance on the hit reality series “Shark Tank” has catapulted his popularity and brought his magnetic personality to the masses. His work as an entrepreneur and business investor is undisputed, and at not even 60 years old, he is far from done.</p>
<p>Mark Cuban shares his wealth of experience and business savvy in his first published book, How to Win at the Sport of Business: If I Can Do It, You Can Do It.<br />

Barbara Corcoran is an American business icon, speaker, consultant, author, investor, and star of the hit show Shark Tank. Her tenacious business attitude and drive to assist other entrepreneurs down their paths to success makes her an audience favorite in the tank. However, her life wasn’t always so clearly defined.</p>
<p>Corcoran was born on March 10th 1949 in Edgewater, New Jersey. The second oldest of 10 children, she was immediately in competition from day one. Her mother was a homemaker and her father was a printing press foreman. She grew up learning the value of a hard work ethic, although Barbara struggled through school, barely managing to pull D’s in most of her classes. She eventually graduated from high school and enrolled at St. Thomas Aquinas College, graduating in 1971.</p>
<p>Once she completed her education she become a teacher, but only stuck with it for one year. Throughout her life, Corcoran has held twenty-two jobs. She credits her work as a waitress at a diner for helping her become the business mogul she is today. During one of her shifts she met a man made Ray Simone, a New Jersey based home builder. The duo started dating and shortly thereafter, she borrowed $1,000 from him to launch her own apartment rental company. However, it wasn’t long before their relationship dissolved.</p>
<p>Simone funded that initial investment of $1,000, but it was Corcoran who helped the company expand. After showing an apartment to a Union Carbide engineer who decided to purchase it rather than rent, Corcoran realized the potential within sales. She posted an ad for a sales agent the following day setting into motion her career in real estate. Within just two years, the Corcoran-Simone company was generating over a half million dollars in sales.</p>
<p>It took several years for the company to dissolve but according to Corcoran, Simone said she would never succeed without him, which further fueled her desire to make a name for herself. They divided the company in 1978 and she founded the Corcoran Group, the first female-run real estate company. The company earned over $350,000 in its first year.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2001 when Corcoran decided it was time to sell the company. She had shifted her focus to family matters, after trying to get pregnant for over eight years and eventually giving birth to her son, Tommy. With negotiations on the table and an annual revenue of $100 million, and realizing she was the top broker in New York City, she told her attorney to find a buyer for $66 million—her lucky number. She sold the company to NRT Inc. within just a few short days.</p>
<p>After exiting the New York City real estate market, Corcoran wanted to get in front of the public in a fresh way. She decided to co-author a book, became a short-lived Fox consultant, and then went on to join the cast of Shark Tank. Her investments and public appearances have helped her multiply her millions and have given her a prominent place among business leaders.</p>

Robert Herjavec is a gregarious entrepreneur who has built and sold several multi-million dollar IT companies and who now runs The Herjavec Group, a fast-growing security software company. His business success has earned him global recognition and seen him chart as a bestseller as the author of “Driven” and “The Will to Win.” Robert is a goldmine for budding entrepreneurs who are looking to tap into some hard-earned wisdom.</p>
<p>It was in Canada that Robert learned his early lessons in the working world, as an immigrant from the farmlands of Croatia discovering what it meant to be poor in an alien economic landscape. He quickly learned to make ends meet as a newspaper deliveryman and a waiter, picking up valuable lessons in relating to his customers, maximizing his tips and turnover.</p>
<p>Before his foray into entrepreneurship, he experienced a variety of industries including working in retail, in film production as an assistant director and even as a collection agent. Adaptability is a trait that Robert emphasizes as key to success for an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Robert’s entry into the tech industry involved him convincing Logiquest, a computer start-up, to let him work there for free. He was under qualified for the position selling IBM mainframe emulation boards, but after 6 months he earned himself a paycheck and went on to become the General Manager. He was eventually fired from the company, which gave him the push to start his own company to keep up with his mortgage payments.</p>
<p>Robert says he’d never thought of becoming an entrepreneur, yet after starting BRAK Systems in his basement, it soon became Canada’s top provider of Internet Security Software, before being sold to AT&amp;T Canada. Within couple of years Robert managed to sell RAMP Networks, another technology company, to Nokia for $225 million.</p>
<p>Robert attributes his success to working in a field that he’s passionate and knowledgeable about.

When called upon in 2009 to be one of the original Sharks, Kevin Harrington had been successfully investing in real estate and other business ventures for almost 30 years, including establishment of his company, Quantum International.  Started in the 1980’s, within a decade Harrington had grown Quantum into a $500 million/year business and increased the value on the New York Stock Exchange from $1 to $20/share.   </p>
<p>Late one night, when he was trying to relax in front of the television, he realized that often the networks had nothing to air except those color bars they used to fill up the space.  It’s common knowledge that many who can’t sleep or perhaps use late night television to keep themselves awake through a night shift are willing to watch most anything.  Why not pitch products to this captive audience?  And so, the Infomercial was born.  </p>
<p>Harrington went on to launch products such as Ginsu Knives, The Food Saver, and The Flying Lure, and established the “As Seen on TV” brand.  He has worked with numerous celebrities including George Foreman, Kim Kardashian, Jack Lalanne, Montel Williams and Bruce Jenner.  </p>
<p>According to Harrington’s website, he has launched more than 500 products that generated well over $5 billion in global sales.  His phenomenal success led to his business model being “used as a class case study for 12 years at Harvard/MIT, illustrating the essential principles of grass-roots entrepreneurship.”  Harrington has also appeared on The Today Show, Good Morning America, CBS Morning News, and in articles in the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times. He founded ERA (Electronic Retailers Association) which now has chapters in 45 countries and EO (Entrepreneurs Organization) with more than 10,000 members.  He teaches at the University of South Florida and serves on the board.  (thesharkgroup).</p>
<p>Kevin Harrington freely shares his investment strategies and recommendations.  In an interview with Andres Diana, LA Managing Director of SeedInvest, in April 2015, he admitted that he has often made mistakes and invested in areas that do not provide him with the returns he wants.  “You get spoiled as an investor when you put up $200,000 and you get back $5 million. …  I’ve gotten killed in the options side of the business. I’ve gotten killed in minerals and futures and things like that. Oil has been devastating for me over the years. You’ve got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them in some of those deals.”</p>
<p>Raising money to support his product development is an experience that Harrington says has flavored his investment philosophy, and figures into some advice that he has for entrepreneurs appearing on Shark Tank.  “They’re all focused on what they want, what they need, as opposed to, ‘How do you get the Shark to write the check?’ When I raise money, I focus on finding the sweet spot of the entrepreneur,” he explained to Andres Diana.   “That is what a lot of people forget about when they’re either investing or raising money, is making sure that the investor can see his return on his investment. That’s the wisdom for the day from a Shark who’s also a guy that raises capital.”   Following this advice, Harrington now has an estimated net worth of $450 million.</p>

Every product that Rohan Oza touches turns to gold, or it may be that Rohan only touches products that are gold that has yet to be mined. He has an uncanny ability for identifying key market trends and is one of the most respected and successful brand builders in the world. </p>
<p>Rohan was born of Indian parents in Zambia, educated in Great Britain and went to graduate school at the University of Michigan. His first position was as manufacturing manager for M&#038;Ms. He told his supervisor that he’d be better in marketing. The supervisor said, in essence, “No, you wouldn’t.” So Rohan quit to pursue an MBA at the University of Michigan. From there, he went to work for Coca-Cola as a marketing manager. Sprite and Powerade sales had slipped dramatically. Rohan reinvigorated the brands by hiring people passionate about the products, redesigning the packaging and enlisting Kobe Bryant as celebrity spokesperson. Sales of Sprite and Powerade soared into the stratosphere. </p>
<p>Regardless of his phenomenal success, Rohan wasn’t comfortable in the corporate culture—a little too “buttoned-down” for his temperament. He resigned to join Glaceau, a $25-million company (compared to Coke’s $70 billion) that was putting vitamins (of all things!) in soft drinks. His colleagues at Coke laughed and wished him luck. It didn’t take long for Rohan to make Vitaminwater and Smartwater household names, and five years after his Coke colleagues laughed, Coke bought Glaceau for $4 billion.    </p>
<p>Rohan founded Idea Merchants Capital to invest in products that are healthier than anything currently on the shelves and build them into iconic brands. His successes include Vita Coco; Health-Ade Kombucha (fastest-growing brand of fermented tea); Pop Chips; Bai (antioxidant infusion drinks); and Chef&#8217;s Cut Real Jerky. </p>
<p>Rohan has many philanthropic endeavors, but closest to his heart is The Children Matter NGO, a partnership between the Starkey Hearing Foundation and Matter Organization, which provides medical equipment and hearing implants, as well as food and other everyday necessities, to underprivileged children in Africa.<br />

Alex Rodriguez is one of the best-known athletes in the world, and he’s accumulated a long list of impressive accolades, including most grand slams in history, member of the 3,000-hit club, picked first in the 1993 MLB draft at age 17, three-time American League MVP, etc., etc., etc.</p>
<p>Alex was born in New York City in 1975. His family returned to the Dominican Republic when he was 4 and later settled in Miami, where his single mother worked three jobs to provide for her children. He excelled in baseball and football in high school and was offered an athletic scholarship to the University of Miami. He decided to go directly into professional baseball and signed with the Seattle Mariners for a $1,000,000 contract and a $1,000,000 signing bonus. </p>
<p>Less well-known is Alex’s talent for business. He started investing while still in his 20s, establishing A-Rod Corp with the purchase of a single duplex in Miami. He and his hand-picked team of accomplished investment professionals grew the corporation into a fully integrated real estate investment and development firm, later branching out into sports, wellness, media and entertainment ventures. Alex believes in keeping it simple: Invest in companies that you are passionate about and can contribute to over and above the capital.</p>
<p>Alex has a long memory for the people and organizations who helped him. He is dedicated to supporting the Girls and Boys Club, donating $1 million to the Miami-Dade chapter and funding scholarships for Girls and Boys Club alumni to attend the University of Miami. He also remains loyal to UM, donating $4 million to renovate the baseball stadium and $500,000 to the UM School of Business Administration.</p>
<p>In addition to guest-sharking, Alex mentors financially strapped former pro athletes on Back in the Game on CNBC.  </p>

Like most women, Sara Blakely had a love/hate relationship with pantyhose. Although their control top eliminated panty lines and made her appear more firm and svelte, the seamed foot looked tacky in open-toe shoes or sandals.  She began to experiment by cutting off the feet, but found that this allowed the hose to curl and roll up her legs.   </p>
<p>After graduating from Florida State University with a degree in communications, Blakely had planned to study law, but due to low scores on the Law School Admissions Test decided to change direction.  She worked for a few months at Disney World and occasionally made appearances as a stand-up comedian.  Then she accepted a position with Danka, an office supply company, selling fax machines door to door.  Not surprisingly she was good at sales and by 1998 had been promoted to a national sales trainer for Danka.  </p>
<p>At 27, Blakely moved to Atlanta, Georgia, and while still working for Danka, spent the next two years and $5,000 in savings developing her prototype.  Once she was satisfied with the design, she drove to North Carolina to pitch it to the numerous hosiery mills there.  She was turned away again and again and returned to Atlanta.  She had learned a (perhaps not so surprising) fact:  the hosiery design and manufacturing business was run solely by men who had likely never used the product!!</p>
<p>She might have been discouraged and given up.  However, she had internalized a critical lesson from her father.   In an article by Melanie Curtin of <span class="nolinks">Inc.com</span> on September 29, 2017, Blakely had described how “…as a child, her father would sit her down at the dining room table and ask her the same question:  ‘What did you fail at this week?’  … And when she told him, do you know what his reaction was?  He high-fived her.”</p>
<p>Blakely admits, “I didn’t realize at the time how much this advice would define not only my future, but my definition of failure.  I have realized as an entrepreneur that so many people don’t pursue their idea because they were scared or afraid of what could happen.  My dad taught me that failing simply just leads you to the next great thing.”  (Fortune, 10/25/12)</p>
<p>And sure enough, not long after she returned to Atlanta, she got a call from a mill operator in Asheboro, North Carolina, who agreed to work with her, because he had mentioned her design to his daughters who convinced him it was a great idea!</p>
<p>Blakely began to market her product, giving it the slightly racy name of Spanx.  She secured a meeting with Neiman Marcus and demonstrated the product by changing in the ladies restroom in front of the Neiman Marcus buyer.  (It’s a good guess that her past experience in stand-up comedy came in handy here.)  This unconventional demonstration resulted in Spanx being sold in seven Neiman Marcus stores, with Bloomingdale, Saks and Bergdorf soon following.</p>
<p>Blakely decided to send a sample of her products to Oprah, and in November, 2000, Winfrey named Spanx one of her “Favorite Things.  Sales skyrocketed and Blakely left Danka to devote full time to her new business.  In the first year Spanx achieved $4 million in sales and $10 million during the second year.  In 2001, Spanx appeared on QVC and sold 8,000 pairs in the first six minutes.   </p>
<p>Since then Spanx has expanded its line to include body suits, bras, and slips, as well as designs for plus sizes, maternity wear, and most recently for men.  Spanx are being sold in over 50 countries, and Blakely has attained the distinction of being the first female self-made billionaire.</p>
<p>Not one to rest on her laurels, in 2006 Blakely launched the Sara Blakely Foundation.  She has supported The Center for Civic Innovation in Atlanta, The Brameen American Social Business Fund, The Malala Fund, and donated $1 million to the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls.  In 2013 she committed to donating at least half of her wealth to philanthropy through the Giving Pledge campaign (started by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett).  All of this is to support what she believes is her most important mission:  To help women feel great about themselves and their potential.  </p>

Born in England in 1950 to a lawyer and a flight attendant, Richard Branson felt he was spinning his wheels in school—he’s dyslexic. He quit at 16 and started a magazine for students, by students and called (What else?) Student, making a profit from the advertising revenue. When the revenue declined, Richard kept the magazine afloat by starting a mail-order record company. (Remember those? Ten free records if you promise to buy six in the next year?) Because he and his cronies were all new to the business world, he called the company Virgin Records. Besides, the name was a bit cheeky back in the early 70s. The mail-order business became a record shop that became a recording studio. Richard signed some of the cream of the rock band crop, such as the Sex Pistols, Culture Club and Genesis, making Virgin Records one of the top six record companies in the world. </p>
<p>Richard went on to establish the Virgin Group, which includes Virgin Airline, Virgin Megastores, Virgin Mobile, Virgin Cola, Virgin Rail, as well as Ulusaba (“place of little fear”), a luxury game reserve in South Africa. His company, Virgin Galactic, is developing commercial spacecraft. For a mere $250,000 a ride, tourists will go into space. He’s already sold around 500 tickets. He’s also working on a “rocket plane” that will fly passengers from New York to Sydney in 30 minutes by taking a detour through space. </p>
<p>Richard has always been compassionate: as a teenager he literally gave the clothes off his back to a homeless man. Now he uses the same determination, hard work and ingenuity that have made him a billionaire to solve today’s most difficult challenges: global conflict, climate change, disease and economic inequity, among them. He was also a founding member of the Giving Pledge with Bill Gates and Warren Buffet and donates half of his annual earnings to philanthropic causes.   </p>

When a celebrity becomes an entrepreneur, or an entrepreneur becomes a celebrity, the issue seems much like that old philosophical question:  which came first, the chicken or the egg?  Bethenny Frankel has managed to answer the question by being both—a celebrity and an entrepreneur.  </p>
<p>Frankel describes her childhood as one of struggle and difficulty.  At the same time, her experiences provided her with a lot of grit and strength and skills that have enabled her to succeed even under difficult circumstances.  She was raised around racetracks in New York; both her father and stepfather were horse trainers.  Frankel told CNBC Make It:  “I mean, I grew up at the racetrack, which is hustlers and gamblers and the betting windows and odds. … It’s a straight hustle all the time, every day. … Life is a horse race, so I grew up at the races.”</p>
<p>In 2005 she appeared on “The Apprentice:  Martha Stewart,” a reality competition series and was one of two finalists.  In 2008 she was selected for the reality television series “The Real Housewives of New York.”  Frankel worked as a bartender, a production assistant, personal assistant to hotel magnate, Kathy Hilton, a natural foods chef marketing Bethenny Bakes, and sold pashminas at house parties before coming up with her idea for a low-calorie cocktail marketed primarily to women.  Initially she had difficulty marketing the idea, but eventually found a partner and established Skinnygirl Cocktail Company.  The business took off faster than anyone expected, and in April of 2011 she sold the company to Beam Suntory for an estimated $100 million.</p>
<p>At the same time she was acting on television and growing a highly successful business, Frankel was also writing self-help books such as “Naturally Thin:  Unleash Your SkinnyGirl and Free Yourself from a Lifetime of Dieting,” and “A Place of Yes:  10 Rules for Getting Everything You Want Out of Life.”</p>
<p>In order to share some of her success with others, Frankel created B Strong, a charitable program that works with the disaster relief organization, Delivering Good, to help people affected by natural disasters.  She has been involved in relief work in Puerto Rico since the devastating hurricane in 2017.</p>
<p>When Frankel sold her Skinnygirl Cocktail business, she retained the right to use the name for other products and she has continued to expand Skinnygirl into a $100 million lifestyle empire, creating products such as Skinny Pop, Skinny Pizza and Skinny Flavored Latte.  Her latest venture is the creation of Skinnygirl Jeans, due to hit the market in August of 2018.  </p>
<p>Perhaps best known for her sass and straightforward, spicy talk, Frankel summed it up by stating to Inc. magazine in 2011:  “I worked hard, I did it on my own and I busted my ass the whole way.  It’s been a long time coming!”	</p>

Chris Sacca participated in the 7th and 8th seasons of Shark Tank after amassing “one of the best portfolios of any investor in tech,” according to Alex Konrad of Forbes in an article published on 4/26/17.  He was likely one of the more colorful guests to appear. Chris recalls that “when I first agreed to do Shark Tank, they asked me to wear a suit, and I was just like, ‘No, I can’t.  It’ll end my career.’”  </p>
<p>Chris earned a JD from Georgetown University, graduating cum laude in 2000.  Although he had always been interested in business and helping to create and build successful enterprises, he reasoned that studying law rather than business or management would enable him to obtain the invaluable critical thinking and negotiating skills that are taught in law school and are indispensable in creating or running a successful business.</p>
<p>During his college years, Chris used his student loans to establish a business enterprise that was ultimately not successful.  With his remaining money he began to trade on the stock market.  In 1998, he discovered a flaw in the software of online trading brokers, exploiting which he managed to earn $12 million in 18 months from just 10–20 thousand dollars.  However, due to some miscalculations on his part, and the economic downturn, he eventually found himself $4 million in debt.  (<span class="nolinks">TheFamousPeople.com</span>).  Not wanting to file bankruptcy, he moved to Silicon Valley to work as an associate attorney at Fenwick &#038; West and worked additional jobs to pay off his debt.  In 2001 he was laid off due to downsizing and experienced several years of frustration and financial difficulty.</p>
<p>Not one to be laid low for long, however, Chris established The Salinger Group.  Working as a consultant he eventually secured a job at Google as Head of Special Initiatives.  By 2007 he had paid off his debts and left Google to become an angel investor.  Making early bets in companies such as Twitter, Uber, Instagram and Kickstarter, by 2017, Forbes estimated his net worth at $1.2 billion, and included him on the Midas List.  </p>
<p>In April of 2017, Chris Sacca decided to retire from the investment world to concentrate on other interests, such as podcasts, mitigating climate change, criminal justice reform and promoting diversity in the startup ecosystem.  It might have seemed more likely that he would just continue to invest and increase his net worth, but he was simply following his own advice:  “Be your unapologetically weird self.”</p>

When Troy Carter was first approached about the possibility of appearing on Shark Tank he turned them down, despite the fact that it is one of his favorite shows.  Carter was accustomed to working behind the scenes representing musicians and working hard to get them into the spotlight, but didn’t feel all that comfortable about being in front of the camera.  </p>
<p>He had a conversation with his wife that changed his mind.  In a 9/10/15 interview with Biz Carson of Business Insider, Carter explained why.  “There are not a lot of black entrepreneurs and I can’t sit there and bitch about diversity in tech … if I’m not out there doing something about that.  … I didn’t know the term ‘venture capitalist.’  It’s so far from my world.”</p>
<p>Carter’s world had not always been easy.  He grew up poor in West Philadelphia and when he was two his parents divorced; when he was seven his father was sentenced to 12 years in prison.  Carter dropped out of high school at 17 to pursue a career in the music industry.  Although his high school rap group, 2 Too Many, was signed by WilJam Records, they lost their contract after only a year and disbanded.  Carter began to work for James Lassiter as a personal assistant and five years later met Sean Combs who hired him as an intern.</p>
<p>Several years later, Carter moved to Los Angeles to work for Lassiter again, but his tenure there was short.  According to Lassiter, Carter began to exhibit an entitled attitude and didn’t want to “pay his dues” by working his way up in the industry.  Lassiter fired him and sent him back to Philadelphia.  </p>
<p>Eventually Carter ended up back in Los Angeles where he was promoting the rap artist, Eve.  Things began to unravel and by 2006 Carter had been fired by Eve and a deal with the British-based firm, Sanctuary, had gone sour.  Carter was deep in debt, his home was foreclosed and his car repossessed.  But then, he was introduced to Stefani Germanotta (calling herself Lady Gaga) who “…walked in with these huge sunglasses on, fishnet stockings, and basically told me how she was going to change the game,” said Carter, in an article by Danielle Sacks (Fast Company, 1/13/14).  </p>
<p>Using a new approach to promoting artists, Carter began to use Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.  According to Danielle Sacks, “At the time, these channels were seen as enemies to the music business, but Carter saw them as inexpensive ways to reach the masses. … The story of the Gaga machine has been the subject of two Harvard Business School case studies: They built a social network for Gaga fans called LittleMonsters.com, connected her with the right companies at the right times, and turned a pop star into a global brand.”</p>
<p>This successful collaboration lasted seven years, and then broke apart.   During those years Carter had begun to invest in different companies such as Uber and Dropbox and while the loss of Lady Gaga was certainly a blow, Carter had learned early in life how to survive adversity and failures and to get back up and keep moving forward. </p>
<p>Carter now has Platinum albums, fame and a net worth estimated at $30 million.  But he knows that all of this can be lost in an instant, and all of this does not ultimately give him the greatest satisfaction.  “Money doesn’t make me tick,” he says.  “This definition of success doesn’t make me tick. Managing some of the biggest stars in the world doesn’t make me tick.  Making my family proud makes me tick.”</p>

If you were a fan of That 70s Show or laughed through Dude, Where’s My Car?, you probably would not have predicted that joining the high level venture capitalists on Shark Tank was anywhere in Ashton Kutcher’s future.</p>
<p>But even though his most prominent roles were as a pretty boy with more brawn than brains, Kutcher had always been a hard-working, intelligent person.  His early life in a middle class family in Iowa gave him a strong work ethic.  He began working construction with his dad at age 10, then worked a variety of jobs, including janitor, butcher and factory worker during his high school years.<br />
When he entered the University of Iowa, Kutcher planned to major in biochemical engineering.  But fate intervened when he won a modeling competition and decided to drop out of college to move to New York.  He eventually ended up in Los Angeles, pursued his interest in acting, and got his big break in 1998 when he got the part of Michael Kelso.</p>
<p>So how did Kutcher go from an actor playing the local pretty boy to sitting pretty next to Mr. Wonderful?  In an interview with Zack O’Malley Greenburg of Forbes in April, 2016, he tells the story:  “A decade ago 50 Cent took an equity stake in Vitaminwater parent Glaceau in exchange for becoming the face of the beverage&#8211;and earned an estimated $100 million when Coca-Cola purchased the company in 2007. … I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Whoa, hold on, wait a second. I&#8217;ve got to figure out how to get in the equity game, because it just makes so much more sense.'&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2011 Kutcher teamed up with music manager Guy Oseary (U2, Madonna) and billionaire Ron Burkle, investing in companies such as Uber, Airbnb, Skype, Spotify and Pinterest.  Within five years the partners had created a portfolio estimated at $250 million and growing.  Along the way they gained additional investors, among them Mark Cuban, David Geffen and Liberty Media.  </p>
<p>Although Kutcher keeps his exact net worth private, in 2017 it was estimated by various sources at somewhere around $200 million.  The roles played by Kutcher the actor simply showcased his talent in acting.  His success in the high stakes world of venture capital clearly demonstrates his ability to recognize opportunity and his drive to take full advantage of it.  When asked by Greenburg in the Forbes interview about how he became such a successful investor, he recalled meeting Silicon Valley elites such as Ron Conway and Michael Arrington.  “I spent 90% of my time just listening,” he said. “Once you learn how to identify a snow leopard, it&#8217;s pretty easy to see a snow leopard coming along.&#8221;</p>

Nick Woodman grew up surfing on the sunny beaches of California. In high school, he started a surfing club, and in college (University of California at San Diego), he joined the fraternity whose house was at the beach. After college, Nick founded two start-ups: <span class="nolinks">EmpowerAll.com</span> that sold electronic goods at a $2 mark-up, and <span class="nolinks">Funbug.com</span>, a gaming and marketing site. Both ventures tanked, and it was off to Australia and Indonesia for some premier surfing.  </p>
<p>It was there that Nick first thought of taking photos and videos of himself surfing. All he needed was a camera that he could attach to his body. GoPro was born. Nick invented a whole new product category and would eventually have the world&#8217;s best-selling cameras. The first cameras were point-and-shoot types worn on the wrist. Later cameras were highly advanced, compact designs, supporting WiFi connectivity. They aren’t only worn on the body; they can be attached to surfboards, ski helmets, bike frames and pets and became the source of many a sensational video on YouTube. </p>
<p>Nick had always lived large. With his success, he could live even larger with toys like an 180-foot yacht, a Gulfstream G5 jet and a fleet of vintage sports cars, and he shares his bounty with his family and long-time friends. He and his wife also share with the less fortunate. They established the Jill + Nicholas Woodman Foundation with 5.8 million shares of GoPro stock and contributed $500 million to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, established to address issues of education, finances, housing, transportation and immigration, not only in Silicon Valley but around the world. </p>

John Paul DeJoria’s life is truly rags to riches: Born into poverty, raised by a single mother, put into foster care, member of Hell’s Angels, homeless, sold Christmas cards as a child to have money for food, later sold encyclopedias to have money for college tuition . . . became a billionaire.  </p>
<p>JP found a place in hair care (even though he was fired from both Redken and Fermodyl) and met Paul Mitchell when they were both selling shampoos and hair conditioners door to door. They pooled their money, $700, and started their own company, John Paul Mitchell Systems, which is today one of the most profitable hair care brands in the world, selling more than 100 different products in 87 countries.</p>
<p>JP’s foray into the tequila business started simply enough: His friend, Martin Crowley, was going to Mexico and JP asked him to bring back the best tequila he could find. Instead, Martin found Francisco Acaraz, a tequila industry veteran. The three of them created Patrón (“the good boss”) Tequila, the highest-quality ever made from 100% blue agave, which confirmed JP’s vision that the world was ready for an ultra-premium, “hipper than thou” tequila. </p>
<p>JP’s philanthropic efforts began at a young age. As poor as they were, his mother would give him a dime to put into the Salvation Army bucket, reminding him that there were people less fortunate than they. He now has his own foundation that raises millions of dollars for causes that reflect his core values of protecting people, animals and the environment. </p>

No other shark can claim both an Academy Award and a Super Bowl ring. In fact, no one can. It is Steve Tisch’s singular achievement. (And it’s actually two Super Bowl rings—2008 and 2012.) </p>
<p>Steve was awarded a Best Picture Oscar (and a Golden Globe) for Forrest Gump, one of the highest grossing films in the history of the motion picture industry and has been among filmdom’s most successful producers for many years. </p>
<p>While attending Tufts University, Steve worked on films in the summer, including as an apprentice for Otto Preminger. After graduation, he became an executive at Columbia Pictures, where he worked on The Lords of Flatbush and brought unknowns Henry Winkler, Perry King and Sylvester Stallone to the screen. In 1983, as co-owner of Tisch/Avnet Productions, he produced the mega-hit Risky Business that sent Tom Cruise soaring into the pop culture stratosphere clad in his Ray-Bans and skivvies. </p>
<p>In 1991, football became an area of interest for Steve: His father, Preston Robert Tisch, a prominent and well-respected businessman, bought 50% of the New York Giants. In 2005, Steve joined the organization as Executive VP. Later that year, upon his father’s death, he became Chairman and co-owner of the team.    </p>
<p>Steve contributes his time and resources to a long list of organizations, including a continued commitment to Tufts University with the Steve Tisch Sports and Fitness Center, as well as providing scholarships and jobs in the movie industry to Tufts students. He is a member of the Board of Advisors at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University and on the Board of Trustees of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Steve and his family donated $10 million to the Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke University and provide ongoing support. </p>
